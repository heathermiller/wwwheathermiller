abstract: 'The most successful systems for “big data” processing have all
adopted functional APIs. We present a new programming model
we call function passing designed to provide a more principled
substrate on which to build data-centric distributed systems. A
key idea is to build up a persistent functional data structure representing
transformations on distributed immutable data by passing
well-typed serializable functions over the wire and applying
them to this distributed data. Thus, the function passing model
can be thought of as a persistent functional data structure that is
distributed, where transformations to data are stored in its nodes
rather than the distributed data itself. The model simplifies failure
recovery by design–data is recovered by replaying function applications
atop immutable data loaded from stable storage. Deferred
evaluation is also central to our model; by incorporating deferred
evaluation into our design only at the point of initiating network
communication, the function passing model remains easy to reason
about while remaining efficient in time and memory. We formalize
our programming model in the form of a small-step operational
semantics which includes a semantics of functional fault recovery,
and we provide an open-source implementation of our model in
and for the Scala programming language, along with a case study
of several example frameworks and end-user programs written atop
of this model.'
