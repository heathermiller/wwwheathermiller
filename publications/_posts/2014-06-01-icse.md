  Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have begun a paradigm shift in higher
  education, with several individual MOOCs boasting tens or hundreds of
  thousands of participants world-wide. Our MOOC on the principles of functional
  programming has more than 100,000 registered students to date, meanwhile
  boasting one of the highest rates of completion (19.2%) for its size. In this
  paper, we describe our experience organizing our popular MOOC, and aim to show
  through many types of collected data that providing innovative
  course-supporting tools (IDE plugins, testing frame- works, interactive build
  tools, automated cloud-based graders, style checkers) and paying attention to
  issues related to human-computer interaction aids distance-learning,
  potentially helping our course achieve its markedly high completion rate.
  Moreover, we have collected an unprecedented amount of course statistics and
  survey results, which has been made available in form of an open-source
  project that additionally provides scripts and tools for generating
  interactive web-based visualizations.
