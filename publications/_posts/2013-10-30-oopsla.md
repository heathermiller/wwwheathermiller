  As more applications migrate to the cloud, and as "big data" edges into even
  more production environments, the performance and simplicity of exchanging
  data between compute nodes/devices is increasing in importance. An issue
  central to distributed programming, yet often under-considered, is
  serialization or pickling, i.e., persisting runtime objects by converting them
  into a binary or text representation. Pickler combinators are a popular
  approach from functional programming; their composability alleviates some of
  the tedium of writing pickling code by hand, but they don’t translate well to
  object-oriented programming due to qualities like open class hierarchies and
  subtyping polymorphism. Furthermore, both functional pickler combinators and
  popular, Java-based serialization frameworks tend to be tied to a specific
  pickle format, leaving programmers with no choice of how their data is
  persisted. In this paper, we present object-oriented pickler combinators and a
  framework for generating them at compile-time, called scala/pickling, designed
  to be the default serialization mechanism of the Scala programming language.
  The static generation of OO picklers enables significant performance
  improvements, outperforming Java and Kryo in most of our benchmarks. In
  addition to high performance and the need for little to no boilerplate, our
  framework is extensible: using the type class pattern, users can provide both
  (1) custom, easily interchangeable pickle formats and (2) custom picklers, to
  override the default behavior of the pickling framework. In benchmarks, we
  compare scala/pickling with other popular industrial frameworks, and present
  results on time, memory usage, and size when pick- ling/unpickling a number of
  data types used in real-world, large-scale distributed applications and
  frameworks.
