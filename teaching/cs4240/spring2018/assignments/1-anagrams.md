## Assignment 1: Anagrams

[Download the anagrams.zip](1-anagrams.zip) handout archive file and extract it somewhere on your machine.

In this assignment, you will solve the combinatorial problem of finding all
the anagrams of a sentence using the Scala Collections API and for-comprehensions.

You are encouraged to look at the Scala API documentation while solving this
exercise, which can be found here:

[http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html)

Note that Scala uses the `String` from Java, therefore the documentation
for strings has to be looked up in the Javadoc API:

[http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html)

## The problem

An anagram of a word is a rearrangement of its letters such that a word with
a different meaning is formed. For example, if we rearrange the letters of
the word `Elvis` we can obtain the word `lives`, which is one of its anagrams.

In a similar way, an anagram of a sentence is a rearrangement of all the
characters in the sentence such that a new sentence is formed. The new
sentence consists of meaningful words, the number of which may or may not
correspond to the number of words in the original sentence. For example,
the sentence:

    I love you

is an anagram of the sentence:

    You olive

In this exercise, we will consider permutations of words anagrams of
the sentence. In the above example:

    You I love

is considered a separate anagram.

When producing anagrams, we will ignore character casing and
punctuation characters.

Your ultimate goal is to implement a method `sentenceAnagrams`, which,
given a list of words representing a sentence, finds all the anagrams
of that sentence. Note that we used the term _meaningful_ in defining
what anagrams are. You will be given a dictionary, i.e. a list of words
indicating words that have a meaning.

Here is the general idea. We will transform the characters of the sentence
into a list saying how often each character appears. We will call this
list _the occurrence list_. To find anagrams of a word we will find all
the words from the dictionary which have the same occurrence list.
Finding an anagram of a sentence is slightly more difficult. We will
transform the sentence into its occurrence list, then try to extract any
subset of characters from it to see if we can form any meaningful words.
From the remaining characters we will solve the problem recursively and
then combine all the meaningful words we have found with the recursive
solution.

Let's apply this idea to our example, the sentence `You olive`. Lets
represent this sentence as an occurrence list of characters `eiloouvy`. We start
by subtracting some subset of the characters, say `i`. We are left with
the characters `eloouvy`.

Looking into the dictionary we see that `i` corresponds to word `I` in
the English language, so we found one meaningful word. We now solve the
problem recursively for the rest of the characters `eloouvy` and obtain
a list of solutions `List(List(love, you), List(you, love))`. We can combine
`I` with that list to obtain sentences `I love you` and `I you love`,
which are both valid anagrams.

## Representation

We represent the words of a sentence with the `String` data type:

```scala
    type Word = String
```

Words contain lowercase and uppercase characters, and no whitespace,
punctuation or other special characters.

Since we are ignoring the punctuation characters of the sentence
as well as the whitespace characters, we will represent sentences
as lists of words:

```scala
    type Sentence = List[Word]
```

We mentioned previously that we will transform words and sentences into
occurrence lists. We represent the occurrence lists as sorted lists of
character and integers pairs:

```scala
    type Occurrences = List[(Char, Int)]
```

The list should be sorted by the characters in an ascending order.
Since we ignore the character casing, all the characters in the occurrence
list have to be lowercase.
The integer in each pair denotes how often the character appears in a
particular word or a sentence. This integer must be positive. Note that
positive also means non-zero -- characters that do not appear in the
sentence do not appear in the occurrence list either.

Finally, the dictionary of all the meaningful English words is represented
as a `List` of words:

```scala
    val dictionary: List[Word] = loadDictionary
```

The dictionary already exists for this exercise and is loaded for you using
the `loadDictionary` utility method.

## Computing Occurrence Lists

The `groupBy` method takes a function mapping an element of a collection to a
key of some other type, and produces a `Map` of keys and collections of
elements which mapped to the same key. This method _groups_ the elements,
hence its name.

Here is one example:

```scala
    List("Every", "student", "likes", "Scala").groupBy((element: String) => element.length)
```

produces:

```scala
    Map(
      5 -> List("Every", "likes", "Scala"),
      7 -> List("student")
    )
```

Above, the key is the `length` of the string and the type of the key is `Int`. Every
`String` with the same `length` is grouped under the same key -- its `length`.

Here is another example:

```scala
    List(0, 1, 2, 1, 0).groupBy((element: Int) => element)
```

produces:

```scala
    Map(
      0 -> List(0, 0),
      1 -> List(1, 1),
      2 -> List(2)
    )
```

`Map`s provide efficient lookup of all the values mapped to a certain key. Any collection
of pairs can be transformed into a `Map` using the `toMap` method. Similarly, any `Map` can
be transformed into a `List` of pairs using the `toList` method.

In our case, the collection will be a `Word` (i.e. a `String`) and its elements are
characters, so the `groupBy` method takes a function mapping characters into a desired
key type.

In the first part of this exercise, we will implement the method `wordOccurrences`
which, given a word, produces its occurrence list. In one of the previous exercises,
we produced the occurrence list by recursively traversing a list of characters.
This time we will use the `groupBy` method from the Collections API (hint: you
may additionally use other methods, such as `map` and `toList`).

```scala
    def wordOccurrences(w: Word): Occurrences
```

Next, we implement another version of the method for entire sentences.
We can concatenate the words of the sentence into a single word and then reuse
the method `wordOccurrences` that we already have.

```scala
    def sentenceOccurrences(s: Sentence): Occurrences
```

## Computing Anagrams of a Word

To compute the anagrams of a word, we use the simple observation that all the anagrams
of a word have the same occurrence list. To allow efficient lookup of all the words
with the same occurrence list, we will have to _group_ the words of the dictionary
according to their occurrence lists.

```scala
    lazy val dictionaryByOccurrences: Map[Occurrences, List[Word]]
```

We then implement the method `wordAnagrams` which returns the list of anagrams of
a single word:

```scala
    def wordAnagrams(word: Word): List[Word]
```

## Computing Subsets of a Set

To compute all the anagrams of a sentence, we will need a helper method which,
given an occurrence list, produces all the subsets of that occurrence list.

```scala
    def combinations(occurrences: Occurrences): List[Occurrences]
```

The `combinations` method should return all possible ways in which we can pick
a subset of characters from `occurrences`. For example, given the occurrence list:

```scala
    List(('a', 2), ('b', 2))
```

the list of all subsets is:

```scala
    List(
      List(),
      List(('a', 1)),
      List(('a', 2)),
      List(('b', 1)),
      List(('a', 1), ('b', 1)),
      List(('a', 2), ('b', 1)),
      List(('b', 2)),
      List(('a', 1), ('b', 2)),
      List(('a', 2), ('b', 2))
    )
```

The order in which you return the subsets does not matter as long as they are
all included. Note that there is only one subset of an empty occurrence list,
and that is the empty occurrence list itself.

Hint: investigate how you can use for-comprehensions to implement parts of this method.

## Computing Anagrams of a Sentence

We now implement another helper method called `subtract` which, given two occurrence
lists `x` and `y`, subtracts the frequencies of the occurrence list `y` from the
frequencies of the occurrence list `x`:

```scala
    def subtract(x: Occurrences, y: Occurrences): Occurrences
```

For example, given two occurrence lists for words `lard` and `r`:

```scala
    val x = List(('a', 1), ('d', 1), ('l', 1), ('r', 1))
    val y = List(('r', 1))
```

the `subtract(x, y)` is `List(('a', 1), ('d', 1), ('l', 1))`.

The precondition for the `subtract` method is that the occurrence list `y` is
a subset of the occurrence list `x` -- if the list `y` has some character then
the frequency of that character in `x` must be greater or equal than the
frequency of that character in `y`.
When implementing `subtract` you can assume that `y` is a subset of `x`.

Hint: you can use `foldLeft`, and `-`, `apply` and `updated` operations on `Map`.

Now we can finally implement our `sentenceAnagrams` method for sequences.

```scala
    def sentenceAnagrams(sentence: Sentence): List[Sentence]
```

Note that the anagram of the empty sentence is the empty sentence itself.

Hint: First of all, think about the recursive structure of the problem: what
is the base case, and how should the result of a recursive invocation be integrated
in each iteration? Also, using for-comprehensions helps in finding an elegant
implementation for this method.

Test the `sentenceAnagrams` method on short sentences, no more than 10 characters.
The combinations space gets huge very quickly as your sentence gets longer,
so the program may run for a very long time. However for sentences such as
`Linux rulez`, `I love you` or `Mickey Mouse` the program should end fairly
quickly -- there are not many other ways to say these things.


## Further Improvement (Optional)

This part is optional and is not part of an assignment, nor will be graded.
You may skip this part freely.

The solution with enlisting all the combinations was concise, but it was not very efficient.
The problem is that we have recomputed some anagrams more than once when recursively
solving the problem.
Think about a concrete example and a situation where you compute the anagrams of the same
subset of an occurrence list multiple times.

One way to improve the performance is to save the results obtained the first time
when you compute the anagrams for an occurence list, and use the stored result if
you need the same result a second time.
Try to write a new method `sentenceAnagramsMemo` which does this.


## Test! Test! Test!

We will run your submissions against a bigger test suite than we provided to
you. So if you want full points, be sure to add your own tests to double check
that you've caught all corner cases.

You can also style check your  by running `styleCheck` in the sbt shell.


## Submission and Evaluation

You will be graded out of 10 points. 2 points are awarded for style; don't
submit code written in a Java-esque style. Again, you can also style check your
code by running `styleCheck` in the sbt shell. 8 points are awarded for
correctness of your solution.
