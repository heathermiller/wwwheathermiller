    abstract: "A textbook about the building blocks we use to build distributed systems. These range
from the small, RPC, futures, actors, to the large; systems built up of these components
like MapReduce and Spark. We explore issues and concerns central to distributed systems
like consistency, availability, and fault tolerance, from the lens of the programming
models and frameworks that the programmer uses to build these systems."
