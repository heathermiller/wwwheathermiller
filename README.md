# Heather Miller's Personal Website: heather.miller.am

Built with Jekyll and Bootstrap 3's responsive-first grid. Glyphs/pictograms
provided by [Entypo](http://entypo.com/). I also use
[Kimono](https://www.kimonolabs.com/) to get custom web scrapes of stuff like
the view-counts of my Speakerdeck presentations.

**Dependencies**: I customized Bootstrap. If you'd also like to edit the less
files (`resources/less`), make sure you install `lessc`. If you have node.js
(and the node package manager [npm](http://nodejs.org/)), installed, all you
have to do is:

    npm install -g less
