# heather.miller.am

Built with Jekyll and Bootstrap 3's responsive-first grid. Glyphs/pictograms
provided by [Entypo](http://entypo.com/). I also use
[Kimono](https://www.kimonolabs.com/) to get custom web scrapes of stuff like
the view-counts of my Speakerdeck presentations.

To build the site, all you need is [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

    gem install jekyll

If you want to customize the less files (I customized Bootstrap), make sure
you install `lessc`. If you have node.js (and the node package manager
[npm](http://nodejs.org/)), installed, all you have to do is:

    npm install -g less
